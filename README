==== NAME ====

SQLite::Work - report on and update an SQLite database.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.0202'' of SQLite::Work.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This generates HTML (and non-HTML) reports from an SQLite database, taking
care of the query-building and the report formatting. This also has methods
for adding and updating the database.

Reports can have nested headers which depend on the sort-order given. One
can select the columns and order in which the values are displayed. The HTML
page generated can be customized with templates.

The SQLite::Work::CGI module has extra methods which deal with CGI using the
CGI module; the included "show.cgi" and "edit.cgi" are demonstration CGI
scripts which use the SQLite::Work::CGI module.

The sqlreport script uses SQLite::Work to generate reports from the
command-line.


==   Limitations   ==

This only deals with single tables and views, and simple one-field,
two-table joins. More complex joins should be dealt with by making a view.

This only deals with one database at a time.


==== REQUIRES ====

    DBI
    DBD::SQLite
    POSIX

    Test::More

    The CGI module requires:

    CGI

    Scripts require:

    Getopt::Long
    Pod::Usage
    Getopt::ArgvFile


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
